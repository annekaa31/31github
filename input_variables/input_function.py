# input() will get user input in console
# Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input

print("Hello " + input("What is your name"))

#Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium. 
#Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. 
#When you run the tests, different inputs will replace the ones in the input area 
#and pass the new inputs through your code.

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
print(num1 * num2)
